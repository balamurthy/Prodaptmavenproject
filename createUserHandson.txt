ToDo: 

In the E2E Test of the Bookstore TestNG class,

By default createuser is not present

Include a TestNG method to create a user with random username in the format "un<randomnumber>"
and a Password "Test@1234"

read the Userid from the response
Store it in a static variable

Execute the rest of the code with the generated Userid

create a new TestNG test case file and first have the createUser method alone

Create a user defined method to generate
